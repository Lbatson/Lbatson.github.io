<h2>Summary</h2>

---
As a software engineer with over a decade of experience, Iâ€™ve built applications for businesses of all sizes. From working with small groups and tight deadlines to lengthy and complex projects spanning multiple teams, I've consistently delivered successful results. Each role has given me the responsibilities of initiating, planning, and implementing various features and improvements, while also managing the work of others along the way. I value and enjoy the learning process and consistent change inherent in software development. It has and will continue to provide me with exciting new challenges and opportunities to adapt and grow both personally and professionally.
